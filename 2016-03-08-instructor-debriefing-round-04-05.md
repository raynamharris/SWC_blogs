On February 23, Rayna Harris, Sheldon McKay, and Tiffany Timbers ran the 4th round of post-workshop instructor debriefing. On March 8th, Rayna Harris, Raniere Silva, and Belinda Weaver ran the 5th round of post-workshop instructor debriefing. 

## What worked well

- **Amazon EC2.** Data Carpentry workshops use the The Amamzon Web Service EC2 instance for cloud computing. For instructions on using EC2 in your workshop, see [this lesson](https://jasonjwilliamsny.github.io/cloud-genomics/)  
 
## New lesson materials

- **Data Carpentry Genomics Lesson.** Greg Wilson recently sent out an email about updating the lesson maintainer roles for Software Carpentry to jump-start finalizing the Ecology and Genomic lessons. These aren't final yet, but the [ISU instructors](ttp://qingpeng.github.io/2016-02-22-isu/) spend about 12 hours putting together a genomics lesson. You can view the git repo with their lessons [here](https://github.com/qingpeng/2016-02-22-isu/tree/gh-pages/lessons) 

- **Python.** On Day 2 of the [UPenn workshop](http://maneesha.github.io/2016-02-22-upenn/), Byron adapted the python materials to teach defensive programing, testing, and other tools that were applicable to the audience and could be incorporated immediately into the learner's research programs. Rayna encouraged Byron to contributing to the development of the new [Python Novice Gapminder](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder/blob/gh-pages/index.md)  

## What could have gone better

- **Picking and choosing parts of the lesson.** A common thing instructors struggle with  is deciding exactly what pieces of a lesson to teach given the time constraints and the skill level of the learners. For instance, Byron reflected that he might could have spent less time of relative/fixed paths in favor of more time spent on scripting. 

We all struggle with this and have different solutions. April Wright shared gets a lot of useful comments, feedback, and suggestions when she tweets or blogs about her lesson. So, good communication is key. Also, a repository of lesson flow charts would be nice, but I don't think that resource exists yet. 

## Installation problems

No new installation problems were noted

## ICUYMI: Thoughts On Combining Debriefing Sessions with Instructor Checkout
Belinda Weaver wrote a [nice post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/03/proposal-instructor-trainees.html) on helping instructor trainees finish their training. Then Greg Wilson [suggested](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/03/should-we-combine-debriefing-and-lesson-discussion.html) combining the lesson discussion with the debriefings. Kate Hertweck [agreed and suggested](http://disq.us/9bowz6) merging the lesson discussion with the pre-workshop help session. 
 
Instructor training is a valuable and critical part of our community, and we value your opinion on these matters. If you haven't already, take a lot at these posts and share your thoughts.   

## Thanks!

We are very grateful to the instructors who attended these debriefing sessions. By taking the time to reflect on their teaching experiences they are helping to strengthen our community.

# A Comparison of Online and In-person Instructor Training Workshops

I have co-taught three instructor training workshops this year (one online and one inperson with Christina Koch and one online with Greg Wilson. 

## Summary
Too long to read? Here's a summary in tabular form. 
| Feature | In Person | Online |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |  
networking | excellent |poor  
etherpad use | poor | excellent
time commitment | prep + class time + <br> travel + paperwork | prep + class time 
private co-instructor communication | in person | Slack & email
potential for technical difficulties | low | high

## Networking 
I think the most amazing feature of an in person workshop is the networking. There is something about face to face conversation during activiites and over coffee, beer, and  dinner that really solidifies personal relations. I became a certified instructor in January 2015 at UC Davis TTT taught by Greg Wilson, Tracy Teal, Bill Mills, and Aleksandra Pawlik. I consider all four of these people to be close colleagues now. Also, I'm going to be visiting a handful of the workshop learned in November when I visit California. Also, I talk to a lot of SWC/DC instructors on-line, but there is something about meeting them in person that feels like its the first time we've met. 

The first time I noticed a lack of networking for the online classes was during a debriefing session earlier this week. It wasn't until 45 minutes into the call that I realized that two of the participants were learners in one my my workshops! I'm glad I finally made the connection, but it made me realize who hard it is to recognize people when you only see a tiny image of them on your screen when you are teaching. 

**What does this mean for next time?** I think next time I teach online, I'll ask each learner to walk up to the camera to introduce themselves during one of the lunch or coffee breaks so I can better associate a name and face. 

## Etherpad Use
The great thing about the etherpad (in my opinion) is that is allows everyone to answer every question. You can put answers in the chat (like a quick yes/no response) or in the main body (like personal experiences or faded examples) rather than just calling on one person to answer. 

During the last in person session with Christina, we often asked students to answer questions out loud rather than using the etherpad, and one of the comments at the end was that this form meant that a lot of people's thoughts/opinions were never heard. 

During the last online session with Greg, we used the etherpad extensively, so I felt like participation was really high. Also, the extensive note-taking allowed Greg to visualize participation during one of the exercises he had to miss. 

**What does this mean for next time?** I think next time I teach in person, I will use the etherpad chat a lot more, especially for quick yes/no responses.

## Time Commitment
Its a lot easier to commit to teaching on line than in person. It doesn't cost me any money upfront for travel, I can make breakfast in my own home, eat dinner with friends, and teach from rooms I'm very familiar with. 

**What does this mean for next time?** All things considered equal, this factor alone makes me much more willing to say yes to co-teaching online rather than in person workshops. 

## Private Co-instructor Communication
The great thing about co-teaching in person is that you easily communicate with your co-instructor during each lesson and during the breaks. You never have to worry about wether you are muted or not, and making decisions about wether or not to change the lesson plan on the fly is pretty easy

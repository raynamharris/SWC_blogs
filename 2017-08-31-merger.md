## Why are Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Merging
Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are currently independent organizations with their own fiscal sponsorship, Steering Committees, governance model, and bank accounts. However,   organizations' operations are organized around shared memberships, shared infrastructure for workshop coordination, shared instructor training program, and joint some staff. This 'separate but collaborative' organizational structure has allowed us to build a community of instructors with more than 1000 certified instructors and 47 current Member Organizations around the worth.

As Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry have continued to grow and develop, this 'separate but collaborative' organizational structure has not scaled meet the needs of the community. Merger discussions have come from the recognition of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are now more mature organizations that can be most effective under a unified governance model with reduced operational overhead and streamlined support for curriculum development and maintenance.

I have co-taught three instructor training workshops this year (one online and one inperson with Christina Koch and one online with Greg Wilson. 

| Feature | Online | In Person

etherpad use | excellent | poor
time commitment | prep + class time | prep + class time + travel + paperwork

## Why online is awesome
In January 2015, I was a learning in the In-person instructor training at UC Davis taught by Greg Wilson, Tracy Teal, Bill Mills, and Aleksandra Pawlik.

Tentative agenda:

1. determine chair (we don't have rules in place that require voting, although it might be nice. It should be someone on the steering committee who can also serve as liaison to that group)
2. organize discussion sessions (who will send out email invites? hosts for next two weeks?)
3. discuss instructor training shepherds (develop plan of action or a proposal?)
4. discuss lesson development for instructors (aggregating and clarifying resources)

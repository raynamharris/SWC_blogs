# A year in review 
I want to thank you for giving me the prilege to serve on the Software Carpentry Steering Committee. Here is a very brief recap of the year. Click this link to read my 2017 election post. 

## A year ago, I said I would focus my efforts on:

1. integrating data from the mentoring and debriefing sessions with the assessment surveys to understand the degree of workshop effectiveness 

2. discussing the above information with lesson maintainers, who can decide if lessons need revision or not

3. integrating the above with instructor-trainers and instructor-mentors to improve lesson delivery and ultimately student success

4. streamlining the above processes so that new trainees can easily be incorporated into these leadership roles

## Here is my recap of what we as a community have accomplished

1. When subcommittees and subcommunities have an overlapping representation, it facilitates the transfer of ideas, concepts, and data across groups. I like to be in multiple groups so that I can better understand and identify shared challenges and opportunities. I'm excited to see some new and revamped programs for 2017 that are the results of share idea with members of the community. I'm really happy with the mentoring program, the communication revamp, monthly meeting, discussion sessions, newsletter, featured Data Carpentry Blogs. 

2. Lesson maintenance has undergone some changes for the better this year. [Click here to read the October 2016 summary from Kate Hertweck](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/10/maintainers-meeting.html).

3. I unexpectedly jumped whole heartedly into the effort to integrate insight from the mentoring committee into the instructor trainer curriculum. Shortly after begin elected, I joined the ranks of the 20 instructor trainers. We had a crash course in training trainers and then were launched into teaching. I must say, I can now relate even better to the new instructors our there. I participated in 5 instructor training workshops and hosted ~10 discussion sessions. 

4. We have elaborated the means to integrate new members into the community and into leadership roles. The community is always inventing and championing new ways to do what we do better. There are many pathways and vehicles for success in this organization, but sometimes its hard to navigate. We are working on improving all forms of communication, and we appreciate your patience and enthusiastic participation as we have navgated these growing pains. 

## From the individual to the community
In the instructor training manual, onc section compared self-directed learning and instructor guided learning. I believe I am constantly learning through mentored- and self- guidance. I think its important to know what balance of the two styles works for you. You could even make an analogy that our community and the organizations we belong to learn and grow in a similar manner. Balance is good.
Communication is important and worth the effort. I'm trying to improve my communication in many ways. I'm glad I'm in good company of hundreds of people who also want to improve their communication, teaching, and research. I like that we can all make progress on this together as a community of geographically diverse members. 
I like hearing from you, and meeting in real life (IRL) is so awesome! I met Greg, Jonah, Belinda, Jason, Kate, Bill, and Maneesha in Cold Spring Harbour. I met Christina in Annapolis Maryland. Kate and I have used our departmental seminar resources to visit each other in Tyler and Austin, Texas. I met instructor trainees in Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland, Toronto, Washington D.C., Arizona, Seattle. Hopefully I'll meet more of you in 2017!

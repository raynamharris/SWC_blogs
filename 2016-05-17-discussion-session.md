Agenda
Welcome and host introduction
Attendees introduction
Name, affiliation/position, purpose for attending
Report from previous workshops (Steve, Christopher)
Materials: Steve: Data Carpentry, spreadsheet, open refine, R, SQL, data viz. 
What worked the best during your workshop? Steve: all worked well! was aimed toward librarians who want to bring data carpentry to the community. best practices. Christopher: 1) sticky notes, 2) getting feedback on every instructor just after they've finished their lesson
What was the biggest hurdle? need to figure out how to update the cirriculum with improvements. need more transparency about communication and pricing. Christopher: differences of trainees' levels -- more advanced trainees are bored when you teach basics, which you cannot skip because there are some beginners
Any changes or additions to lesson material? Christopher: no
Minor tip for instructors: It's better to use "black characters on white background" in your terminal -- the contrast is better and text is more readable.
Preparing for upcoming workshops (Daniel, Mark)
overview: Mark: REU workshop for 5 days. Joslynn is doing genomics with undergrads at JCVI (06/26), can share the items later . Motivation level of students is important. key is to have pertenent datasets. Mark will use an oklahoma space dataset rather than inflammation.

## Why are Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Merging
Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are currently independent organizations with their own fiscal sponsorship, Steering Committees, governance model, and bank accounts. However,   organizations' operations are organized around shared memberships, shared infrastructure for workshop coordination, shared instructor training program, and joint some staff. This 'separate but collaborative' organizational structure has allowed us to build a community of instructors with more than 1000 certified instructors and 47 current Member Organizations around the worth. 

As Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry have continued to grow and develop, this 'separate but collaborative' organizational structure has not scaled meet the needs of the community. Merger discussions have come from the recognition of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are now more mature organizations that can be most effective under a unified governance model with reduced operational overhead and streamlined support for curriculum development and maintenance. 

## Highlights from our history
*If you aren't intimately familiar with the history of Software and Data Carpentry, take a moment to review these highlights; otherwise, skip forward to the next section.*

Software Carpentry was founded in 1998 by Dr. Greg Wilson and Dr. Brent Gorda to teach researchers better software development skills. In 2012 with the support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Software Carpentry became a project with the Mozilla Science Lab and began to scale its ability to run workshops. In 2014, several Software Carpentry instructors associated with the National Science Foundation BIO Centers (Dr. Karen Cranston, Dr. Hilmar Lapp, Dr. Tracy Teal, Dr. Ethan White) developed a new curriculum and workshop focused particularly on the needs of people new to computation who now needed and wanted computational skills to work with the data they were generating. With the support of Wilson, they called this new initiative Data Carpentry. From the beginning Software and Data Carpentry were aligned around the common element of instructor community and training and workshop organization. However, reating separate organizations at that time allowed both organizations to be more agile and respond independently and appropriately to curriculum and community needs. A grant to Data Carpentry from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in 2015 helped support the growth of Data Carpentryâ€™s domain-specific teaching approach as well as the joint instructor training program.

## Decisions made so far about the merger
Members of both the SWC and DC steering committees and staff have been meeting regularly to outline the steps for transitioning from two independent organizations to one united organization. The steering committees have passed the following resolution about the structure and governance of the combined organization. 
- The Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry steering committees approve the merger of the two organizations into a single umbrella organization with associated lesson organizations, with a starting date of January 1, 2018
- The Steering Committee of combined organization will be composed of 9 members, each serving a two year term without limits on the number of terms. Five members will be appointed through a process of nomination  while the other four members will be elected.
- The combined organization will have an Executive Director who reports to the Board of Directors. Initially, this position will be offered to Dr. Tracy Teal.
- The combined organization will have a Director of Business Development who reports to the Executive Director. Initially, this position will be offered to Jonah Duckles. 

## Next Steps in the merger
There are many areas of work to be done before January 1, 2018. Here is a summary of the next steps and how to can get involved.
